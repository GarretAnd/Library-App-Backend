# Lab 5 + SA 8
By Garret Andreine

# What Worked
- Making components was fun
- Having the framework for Auth in the future is neat

# What Didn't Work
- Literally everything was a battle
- Mongoose has bad docs
- Auth is hard
- Axios Scares me
- Heroku is evil
- CORS policy sucks
- Windows is inferior
- I love you Tim 
- Thank god for Ian Hou, Thomas Clark, and Nathan Schneider


Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://lab4-backend.herokuapp.com/)
